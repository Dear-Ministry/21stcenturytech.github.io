    <p>This is a website to let Adriana LaGrange know that her website domain name had expired and has been purchased by a non-political, private individual that lives in Alberta.</p>

<p>This is not a website paid for by any corporation or political party, and thus, it does not promote any specific business or political party.</p>

<p>This website exists to highlight the importance of technology in our ever-changing world and that choosing to not fund technology in Alberta classrooms will be detrimental to the future of Alberta.</p>

<p>This website does not collect any private information and does not use any cookies.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-are-adriana-lagrange-the-previous-owner-of-this-domain">If you are Adriana LaGrange (the previous owner of this domain)</h3>

<p>I will forfeit the domain and transfer it back to you if you donate $2500 to the <a href="https://mindfuel.ca">Science Alberta Foundation, AKA Mindfuel</a> supporting STEM learning in Alberta.</p>

<p>Email receipt of the donation to IForgotToRenewMyDomain@adrianalagrange.com and we can work together to transition the domain back to you.</p>
